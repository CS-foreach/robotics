`CHANGEME` Premise, aka the topic that you are trying to teach in sentence form. Should
convey the key interesting factors and how they might relate to the learning
goals. It should also explain what activities are conducted and what the 
original audience for the workshop was. Any future workshops should fork the
original workshop it was based on inside the GitHub/CSFE organization.

## Learning Goals:

Learning goals set the end goal of the workshop of lesson plan. What are the key
takeaways? This helps curriculum developers determine what is supplemental and 
what is important.

- Describe the concept of [x] in [y]
- Use [x] to solve [y]
- Explain the importance of [x] in [y] context
- Determine between [x], [y], [...] which approach is best for what context
