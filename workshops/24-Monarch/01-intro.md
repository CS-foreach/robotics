## Agenda
Don't know where to start? Try using the [PRIMM](https://primmportal.com/) framework.

1. Review agenda

 3. Vote on what units to work on next
    1. movies
    2. competition
    3. invention

## After Action Report
- Attendance: 4 students (J, M, R, N)
- Wins:
    - M and N were really engaged with the discussion
    - M literally wants to be a robotics engineer
    - N wants to be a musician (there are lego robot music units)
    - Inventory is 6 completely new LEGO Prime kits
    - Small class is very manageable
    - J was trying his best to not engage in the material but has demonstrated
        an inkling of effort to engage in the discussion when prompted. Additionally
        J seems interested in actually building the robot, not the philosophy
- Fixes:
    - The discussion had too many examples to dig through
    - the order of the discussion pairings had the more difficult classifications
        too early
    - The discussion could have a more streamlined checklist
    - The agreed upon definition of "robot" is technically wrong (they classified
        i-pads as robots as well??) and seem to casually reject the more traditional
        definition of robots
    - Some movie-related examples are complete misses (ie. star wars)
      - we need to either identify more broad examples to draw from or 
        share the culturally relevant clips / examples to pull from
    - job-related introduction question should've been more appropriate for 
        middle school, some students chose not to engage it in whatsoever (J, R)
