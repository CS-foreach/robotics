## Scaffolding Order
It's important to build skills in the right order to achieve a better learning
experience that complements prior lessons.

The general recommendation for robotics is:
1. Building a robot chassis with guided instruction
1. Introducing motor systems
1. Introducing sensor systems
1. Combinning motors + sensors

The scaffolding order for this class will roughly be:

1. What is a robot / mechanical system
1. Building structures / objects
  1. our aim here is to see what level their spatial reasoning skills are
  1. we can also encourage buildnig for aesthetics
1. Simple machines?
  1. simple machines makes some operatons easier without the usage of motors
  1. mastery over non-motor-based machines is important
  1. allows us to reinforce or otherwise introduce more nuanced building 
    techniques
1. Builiding with a motor (how to build moving parts and lock axis)
  1. static machines can be automated with motors
  1. motors introduce more motion, how do we contain the motion
  1. consider unstable designs
  1. students will run instructor-provided code
1. Programming motors
  1. Introducing programming concepts with a motor
  1. The physical design of the motor should not be the point of this lesson
1. Builiding with several motors (how to not fight each other)
  1. Introducing more than one motor allows us to have more complex systems of 
    either related or non-related motor systems
1. Building with sensors
  1. Introducing sensors / input lends us more senses to see our world differently
  1. Introduces input, noise, etc.
1. Building with several sensor options
  1. Learners need to pick the right sensor for the job
1. Building with sensors and motors
  1. Combining both sensors and motors to create a non1.vehicle system
1. Building vehicles
  - Vehicles pose the additional challenge of a different form of locomotion / 
    non-ego-centric framing
1. Designing for a specific task
1. Designing for an end-user

## Day 01 - Introduction to LEGO robotics
### Learning Goals
- ice breaker: what is your favorite robot
- define what a robot is
  - show examples of current robots
- assess the current skill level in finding pieces and making projects
  - learn how to design static structures
- learn how to clean up
- vote on which lesson plan to choose from:
  - business
  - competition
  - life hacks
  - invention

## Day XX - Presentation Day
- final day should generally be a presentation day
- if ESL / disadvantaged background / shy, as a teacher, go up and help present the project with the student
- give them (animal award on paper) for `this many loops, etc.`
- make presentation day a party (bring food)
