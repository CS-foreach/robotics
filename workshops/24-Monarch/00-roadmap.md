## Scaffolding Order
It's important to build skills in the right order to achieve a better learning
experience that complements prior lessons.

The general recommendation for robotics is:
1. Building a robot chassis with guided instruction
1. Introducing motor systems
1. Introducing sensor systems
1. Combinning motors + sensors

The scaffolding order for this class will roughly be:

1. What is a robot / mechanical system
1. Building structures / objects
  - our aim here is to see what level their spatial reasoning skills are
  - we can also encourage buildnig for aesthetics
1. Simple machines?
  - simple machines makes some operatons easier without the usage of motors
  - mastery over non-motor-based machines is important
  - allows us to reinforce or otherwise introduce more nuanced building 
    techniques
1. Builiding with a motor (how to build moving parts and lock axis)
  - static machines can be automated with motors
  - motors introduce more motion, how do we contain the motion
  - consider unstable designs
  - students will run instructor-provided code
1. Programming motors
  - Introducing programming concepts with a motor
  - The physical design of the motor should not be the point of this lesson
1. Builiding with several motors (how to not fight each other)
  - Introducing more than one motor allows us to have more complex systems of 
    either related or non-related motor systems
1. Building with sensors
  - Introducing sensors / input lends us more senses to see our world differently
  - Introduces input, noise, etc.
1. Building with several sensor options
  - Learners need to pick the right sensor for the job
1. Building with sensors and motors
  - Combining both sensors and motors to create a non-vehicle system
1. Building vehicles
  - Vehicles pose the additional challenge of a different form of locomotion / 
    non-ego-centric framing
1. Designing for a specific task
1. Designing for an end-user

## Day 01 - Introduction to LEGO robotics
### Learning Goals
- ice breaker: what is your favorite robot
- define what a robot is
  - show examples of current robots
- assess the current skill level in finding pieces and making projects
  - learn how to design static structures
- learn how to clean up
- vote on which lesson plan to choose from:
  - business
  - competition
  - life hacks
  - invention

## Day XX - Presentation Day
- final day should generally be a presentation day
- if ESL / disadvantaged background / shy, as a teacher, go up and help present the project with the student
- give them (animal award on paper) for `this many loops, etc.`
- make presentation day a party (bring food)
